# homelab_notes
I have MS and it has badly affected my memory, but I enjoy learning and creating things, so I find myself constantly googling for reminders on how to do things I've done before.

Often this can take considerable time, due to so much information being out there that is just plain out of date, or did not work for what i wanted to do.

This repo is just my notes to remind myself of how I have setup a few things, i have no doubt that there are better ways to do it, but this at least got me up and running.

I have included the ansible files, maybe they will help someone else get started.
