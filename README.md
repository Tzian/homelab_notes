# homelab_notes
I have MS and it has badly affected my memory, but I enjoy learning and creating things, so I find myself constantly googling for reminders on how to do things I've done before.

Often this can take considerable time, due to so much information being out there that is just plain out of date, or would not work for what you are trying to do.

This repo is just my notes to remind myself of how I have setup a few things here, it will always be a WIP as I learn more and update it accordingly.
